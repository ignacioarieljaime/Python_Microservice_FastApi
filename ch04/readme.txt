=========================== Description ====================================

This prototype is a mini-ERP system divided into sub-applications: 
the student, faculty, and library modules. It has a one-point access 
mechanism to these sub-applications to centralize all request and response 
transactions. The student module creates the grades, provides the student roster, 
and stores student grades, while the faculty module provides the course 
assignment and gives the course grades to students. On the other hand, 
the library manages the reservation, return, and storage of books in the library. 

This application uses the FastAPI framework driven by Python 3.8.
