This is the code repository for [Building Python Microservices with FastAPI](https://www.packtpub.com/product/building-python-microservices-with-fastapi/9781803245966?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781803245966), published by Packt.

**Build secure, scalable, and structured Python microservices from design concepts to infrastructure**

## What is this book about?
FastAPI is an Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI)-based framework that can help build modern, manageable, and fast microservices. Because of its asynchronous core platform, this ASGI-based framework provides the best option when it comes to performance, reliability, and scalability over the WSGI-based Django and Flask. When working with Python, Flask, and Django microservices, youâ€™ll be able to put your knowledge to work with this practical guide to building seamlessly manageable and fast microservices.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Understand, orient, and implement REST APIs using the basic components of the FastAPI framework
* Build asynchronous as well as synchronous REST services using the built-in pydantic module and asyncio support
* Create small-scale and large-scale microservices applications using features supported by FastAPI
* Build event-driven and message-driven applications using the framework
* Create an asynchronous and synchronous data layer with both relational and NoSQL databases

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter01.

The code will look like the following:
```
@app.get("/ch01/login/")
def login(username: str, password: str):
    if valid_users.get(username) == None:
        return {"message": "user does not exist"}
    else:
        user = valid_users.get(username)
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**

This book is for Python web developers, advanced Python users, and backend developers using Flask or Django who want to learn how to use the FastAPI framework to implement microservices. Readers familiar with the REST API and microservices will also benefit from this book. Some parts of the book contain general concepts, processes, and instructions that intermediate-level developers and Python enthusiasts can relate to as well.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-11).
